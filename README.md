# reene
[react native app](https://reactnative.dev/) to report dirt to [Dresden's Dreck-Weg](https://sauber.dresden.de/de/dreck-weg-app.php) faster

## dev
uses [expo.io](https://expo.io/) to easily develop the [app](reene/App.js)

since I don't own the original backend, I have written a [backend-mock](backend-mock/backend.js) based on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
